# Hangman-Game-in-Python
Created a hangman game in Python that allowed the player enter desired length of the word they want to guess, then picked the random word from a dictionary that matches this length. The player guess one letter at a time and the program checked if that letter is in the current word. Keep tracking incorrect guesses and continues until the player runs out of allowed attempt. Print out "Congratulation" if the player guessed the word correctly, otherwise print the player has lost. After each game, keep asking if the player would like to play the game again. This program includes exception handling to manage invalid letter or length
